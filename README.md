# I've Spoken

**I've Spoken** pops a RPG-like dialog on top of one's name when he or she speaks, and lasts for about 5 seconds(configurable) before vanishing.

It's just something like this:

![I've spoken.](https://github.com/KrLite/Ive-Spoken/blob/artwork/content/Spoken.png)

The content will be truncated if too long (configurable).
