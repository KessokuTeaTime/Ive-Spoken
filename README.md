# I've Spoken

**I've Spoken** pops an RPG-like dialog on top of one's name when he or she speaks, and lasts for about 5 seconds before vanishing (configurable).

It's just something like this:

![I've spoken.](https://github.com/KessokuTeaTime/Ive-Spoken/blob/artwork/content/spoken.png)

The content will be truncated if too long (configurable).

## Configuration

You can now configure **I've Spoken** by editing the configuration file at `/config/ivespoken.toml`. With **[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)** installed, you can also configure this mod through an in-game GUI.
